/**
 * This directory exposes our underlying models. The naming scheme is based on
 * the stage of the processing pipeline that an object is produced by.
 *
 * The pipeline looks like:
 *   load: reads in bytes from filesystem/network
 *   parse: convert bytes to abstract syntax trees
 *   scan: extract entirely local features from a single ast
 *   resolve: integrate cross-file information to produce the final result
 *
 * Importantly, we can cache everything before `resolve` at the file level,
 * making incremental analysis efficient.
 *
 * Because the output of the resolve phase is the API that will get the most
 * use, its results have clear, unprefixed names. So a resolved document is just
 * a Document, a resolved element is an Element.
 *
 * Earlier stages have the longer names, like ParsedDocument and ScannedElement.
